Unpack files somewhere on your server\r\n2. Enter directory with the files ex. `cd stream-recorder`\r\n3. Run `npm install` command\r\n4. Now you should able to run the server by `node server.js`\r\n\r\n**NOTICE:**\r\nServer run default on port 22810 to change it need to edit `server.js` file. To change port which it runs edit `server.listen(22810);` to `server.listen(YOUR_PORT);` where YOUR_PORT is port number;\r\n\r\nAlso need to edit `client/index.html` file:\r\n\r\n**In `<script>` tag in `<head>` section**\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar HOST = '127.0.0.1', <- here change `127.0.0.1` to your server external IP\r\nvar PORT =  22810, <- here change port number to one you choose\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Later at the end of <body> tag**\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar options = {\r\n    recorder: {\r\n        monitorGain: 0,\r\n        bitDepth: 16, // 8, 16, 24, 32\r\n        numberOfChannels: 1,\r\n        sampleRate: 48000,\r\n        recordOpus: true\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nOnce you run server open `127.0.0.1:22810` in your browser (browser will ask you to give permission to use your microphone). You should see *Recorder* section and *Log* section. In the *Log* section you should see `Connected to the stream server localhost on port 22810 ` message.\r\n\r\nOn the *Recorder* section you will see waveform container and some buttons:\r\n\r\n- *Init* - initializes the recorder, it will starts to listen to audio from microphone, but not yet send it to the server.\r\n- *Record (red dot)* - Once you push it, it starts recording audio and streaming it to the server. When you push it during recording it pauses it, then push it again to resume.\r\n- *Stop (square)* - It stops the recording.\r\n- *Fill color* and *Background color* - You can set the colors of waveform there **NOTICE: you have to do that before initialize.**",
